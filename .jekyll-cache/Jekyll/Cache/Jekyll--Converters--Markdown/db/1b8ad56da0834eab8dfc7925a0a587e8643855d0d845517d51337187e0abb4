I"Æ<p><strong>5th-level divination (ritual)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong>: Self</p>

<p><strong>Components</strong>: V</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</p>

<p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you canâ€™t take actions, canâ€™t understand what other creatures say, canâ€™t read, and speak only in gibberish. A <em><a href="greater-restoration">Greater Restoration</a></em> spell cast on you ends this effect.</p>

<p>On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as â€œyes,â€ â€œno,â€ â€œmaybe,â€ â€œnever,â€ â€œirrelevant,â€ or â€œunclearâ€ (if the entity doesnâ€™t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.</p>
